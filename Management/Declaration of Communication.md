# Motivation

It has been a while since the discussion group was created, much have happened around the world but not much seem have happened within the phasing community itself.

To a large extent, Phasing and related experience is still being treated like some mythological phenomena, and people approach it in a manner resemble superstition. It's my intention to clarify the myths around the phenomena and promote more useful and healthy exploration into Phase.
